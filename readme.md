The greatest common divisor of two positive integers, n and m, is the largest number, d, which divides evenly into both n and m. There are several algorithms that can be
used to solve this problem, including:

Initialize _d_ to the smaller of _m_ and _n_.
**While** _d_ does not evenly divide _m_ or _d_ does not evenly divide _n_ **do**
Decrease the value of d by 1
Report _d_ as the greatest common divisor of _n_ and _m_

Write a program that reads two positive integers from the user and uses this algorithm to determine and report their greatest common divisor.
